"""Unit tests for ToolAnnotations derivation across the full tool surface.

The MCP 2025-06-18 spec defines five optional ``ToolAnnotations`` hints. This
test suite asserts that:

1. The single source of truth (``annotations_for_classification``) returns the
   canonical hint set for each classification bucket.
2. ``classify_tool_name`` correctly maps every Appwrite SDK service verb into
   the appropriate bucket — parametrized across the 25 SDK services.
3. The 4 public operator tools (``appwrite_get_context``, ``appwrite_search_tools``,
   ``appwrite_call_tool``, ``appwrite_search_docs``) carry the right annotations
   for their semantic role.
4. The dynamic SDK tool generator (``service.Service.list_tools``) produces
   tools with annotations matching the action verb in their name.
5. ``annotations_for_gateway`` advertises a *gateway* profile (destructiveHint
   unset) so MCP clients default to destructive and prompt the human user —
   matching the ``confirm_write=true`` runtime boundary inside the server
   (see appwrite/mcp#87 Greptile P1 review).

Why this suite exists:

- A single helper mistake would silently mislead every MCP client that filters
  on these hints (claude-code, Gemini MCP, Appwrite broker).
- The 25 SDK services generate ~hundreds of tool names; sampling a handful is
  not enough to catch a bug in the verb parser.
- The operator's `_classify_verb` (private) and the annotations module's
  `classify_tool_name` (public) must stay in lock-step; we verify they agree on
  every classification the operator uses.
- A gateway tool that exposes a static ``destructiveHint=False`` is a security
  hole: clients use the hint to decide whether to prompt the human user, and
  the spec default of ``true`` (when unset) is the only safe answer for a
  dispatcher whose outcomes depend on caller-supplied input. Pinned by the
  Greptile review on appwrite/mcp#87.
